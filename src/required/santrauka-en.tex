This paper explores the possibilities of using the IOTA platform in specific supply chain processes. The thesis analyzes the subject area of supply chains, its concept, structure and problems. The distributed ledger technology and its requirements in the context of supply chains are described. The types of technology based on the principles of blockchain and directed acyclic graphs were analyzed, their properties, advantages, and disadvantages were presented. An exemplary supply chain model and discrete examples of the application of the IOTA platform at specific stages were designed to support the usability of the platform in supply chains. Application alternatives provided. The thesis suggests the most important tasks and activities of the potential system to implement the practical application.
